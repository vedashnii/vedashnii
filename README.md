# Hello!
### 🕯️ ** About Me **
<!-- social media -->

I'm interested in human-centered design, climate tech, and responsible AI policy. My strengths are design, data analytics, and front-end development. I love to make visualizations and pore over fonts and color.

🎓 Data Science and Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley
